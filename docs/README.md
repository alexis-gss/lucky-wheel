# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for my [Lucky Wheel](https://lucky-wheel.alexis-gousseau.com) project.

Thanks to the latter, you'll learn not only the main purpose of this project, but also the procedures to follow to install and configure this project on your own.

## Introduction

As you might have guessed, this project is an online wheel of luck.

The aim was to create a random response based on the values entered previously. I had to find a way of representing this functionality, and the idea of a wheel of chance quickly came to mind, since the result will be a surprise.

## Overview
